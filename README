INTRODUCTION
------------

This is an example of a basic tile-based, 2D game using
Android's Canvas. It can be used as a base for your own games.

This code provides a simple way to build maps based on your own
tiles, player movement / tracking and detection of collisions
with any number of different tile types.

This code is used in the Android game Radius:

IMPORTANT FILES
-------------

src/org/ruscoe/example/tilegame/data/GameDAO.java

This file populates the games database with tile and map data.

It contains an example of how to define custom tiles and how
to use those tiles to build custom maps for your game's levels.

src/org/ruscoe/example/tilegame/GameView.java

This generates the game view and handles all game logic and
user input.

The function parseGameLevelData shows how the tile and map
data in the database is translated into a playable game level.
